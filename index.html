                    my interests span personal informatics, the politics of data, secure communication systems, social media, surveillance studies, and critical infrastructure studies. my long-term goal is to distill insights from feminist sts, critical race, and media infrastructure studies to build technical systems that are innovative, accountable, and sensitive to the human experience. as a researcher i’m driven by the notion of “studying up.”
