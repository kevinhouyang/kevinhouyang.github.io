                <h3>i’m a software developer and recent graduate from Brown University, where my research is advised by Professor Jeff Huang at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab. i’m the main developer for Self-E, a mobile user system that leverages remotely-captured user data to enable self-discovery. currently, i'm a blockchain developer intern at BlockApps.

                    <br />
                    i have research interests that are technical (implementation of novel user systems) as well as ones rooted in the humanities and social sciences (infrastructure studies, science/technology studies). one long-term goal of mine is to feel i am living up to what it means to cultivate a critical technical practice.            </h3>
