                <h3><b>I'm a software engineer and human-computer interaction researcher.</b> I graduated from Brown University in 2020 with in Sc.B. in Computer Science, where my research was advised by Professor Jeff Huang at <a href="https://hci.cs.brown.edu/">Brown HCI</a>. I was an investigator on <a href="http://selfe.cs.brown.edu/">Self-E</a>, an automated system that leverages remotely-captured user data to scaffold self-discovery and n-of-1 experimentation. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445100">Our paper</a>, on which I was a second co-author, was accepted at ACM CHI 2021.

                <br>
                Currently, I am at the <a href="https://www.aasc.ucla.edu/">Asian American Studies Center</a> at UCLA. We're uplifting Asian American and Pacific Islander histories by building an open-access multimedia digital textbook to be used in high school curriculums. Previously, I have worked at Meta, <a href="https://www.freewheel.com/beeswax">Beeswax (acquired by FreeWheel)</a>, and <a href="https://www.anomalo.com/">Anomalo</a>. I'm also a proud alum of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>!
